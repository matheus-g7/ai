This project is a **text-based emotion detection system** built in Python using the **IBM Watson NLP Emotion Predict API**.

It analyzes English text input and returns emotion confidence scores for:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Joy
- Sadness

Additionally, the system identifies the **dominant emotion** based on the highest confidence score.

This project was developed as part of an **IBM / Coursera applied AI and NLP learning path** and follows industry-standard practices for clean code, error handling, and API integration.
